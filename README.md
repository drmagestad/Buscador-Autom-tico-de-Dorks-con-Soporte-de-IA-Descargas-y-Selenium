## Overview

This script automates **advanced Google Dork searches** using the **Google Custom Search API** or **Selenium** for browser automation. It allows users to perform efficient and powerful searches, ideal for **OSINT** and **pentesting** purposes. The script leverages AI to generate Google Dorks and can download specific files from search results.

## Key Features

- **Automated Dork Generation (AI)**: 
  - Generates search queries using **GPT-4** (via the OpenAI API) or **GPT4All** based on user input.

- **Google Search Automation**: 
  - Perform searches using either the **Google API** or an **automated browser** through **Selenium**.
  
- **Results Export**: 
  - Export results in **JSON** or **HTML** format for further analysis or reporting.

- **File Download**: 
  - Download specific files (e.g., PDFs, images, documents) directly from search results, filtered by file type.

- **Interactive Configuration**: 
  - Easily configure your **API keys** and other environment variables with the interactive `.env` setup.

## Use Cases

This tool is perfect for professionals involved in:

- **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**: Gather relevant data from publicly available online resources.
- **Pentesting**: Automate Google Dork searches to find vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and sensitive information exposed on the web.
- **Cybersecurity Research**: Conduct in-depth research and analysis with advanced search techniques and AI-powered automation.
